# Connect4 #
A text based connect four game written in Python 3.

## Features ###
Single and double player games.

Tokens are animated while dropping.

Size of the board can be manually changed. As the board gets bigger, more connected tokens are required to win. 


#### Powerups ####
Players can choose to use powerups in the beginning of the game. The number of powerups players get (the computer player won't recieve any) is based on board size. After a powerup is used, all tokens will fall to the lowest spot in the column.

Powerups include:

* flipping a row
* destroying (bombing) a token
* randomizing a row
